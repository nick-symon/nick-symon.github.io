  <h1>Hi, I'm Nick!</h1>
  <h3>I'm a software developer that lives to write maintanable code in Ruby, Go, and React.</h3>
  <p>I live in Chicago with my wonderful wife and our cat Tofu</p>
  <p>In my free time, I love going to the cinema (especially the music box theater), working out, travelling, and playing Fallout: New Vegas.</p>
  <p>Prior to becoming a software developer, I worked in the Accounting industry for a number of years.</p>
  <p>Some of the projects I've worked on include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.stalepopcorn.org">Stale Popcorn</a>: A site that aggregates and organizes movie listings from indie movie theaters in Chicago. Built with Ruby on Rails</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Please reach out, I'd love to hear from you!</p>
